## Summary

This is an adaptation of [CSJ2K](http://csj2k.codeplex.com/), which provides JPEG 2000 decoding and encoding functionality to .NET based platforms. *CSJ2K* is by itself a C# port of the Java 
package *jj2000*, version 5.1. This is a fork of *CSJ2K* for .NET Standard 2.1 making it possible to implement JPEG decoding and encoding on any platform.

## Installation

Apart from building the relevant class libraries from source, pre-built packages for the supported platforms can also be obtained via [NuGet](https://nuget.org/packages/CSJ2K.Skia/).

## Usage

The Library provides interfaces for image rendering, file I/O and logging.

### Decoding

To decode a JPEG 2000 encoded image, call one of the following methods:

```csharp
public class J2kImage
{
	public static PortableImage FromStream(Stream, ParameterList = null);
	public static PortableImage FromBytes(byte[], ParameterList = null);
	public static PortableImage FromFile(string, ParameterList = null);
}
```

The returned `PortableImage` offers a "cast" method `As<T>()` to obtain an image in the type relevant for the platform. When using the `SKBitmapImageCreator` on .NET, a cast to `SKBitmap` or `SKPixmap` would suffice:

    var bitmap = decodedImage.As<SKBitmap>();

### Encoding

To encode an image, the following overloads are available:

```csharp
public class J2kImage
{
	public static byte[] ToBytes(object, ParameterList = null);
	public static byte[] ToBytes(BlkImgDataSrc, ParameterList = null);
}
```

The first overload takes an platform-specific image `object`. This is still works-in-progress, but an implementation is available for `SKBitmap` objects.

The second overload takes an *CSJ2K* specific object implementing the `BlkImgDataSrc` interface. When *Portable Graymap* (PGM), *Portable Pixelmap* (PPM) or JPEG2000 conformance testing format (PGX) objects are available as `Stream`s, 
it is possible to create `BlkImgDataSrc` objects using either of the following methods:

    J2kImage.CreateEncodableSource(Stream);
	J2kImage.CreateEncodableSource(IList<Stream>);
	
For *PGM* and *PPM* images, you would normally use the single `Stream` overload, whereas for *PGX* images, you may enter one `Stream` object per color component.
